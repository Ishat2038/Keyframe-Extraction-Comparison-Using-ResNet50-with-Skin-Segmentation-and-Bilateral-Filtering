# Keyframe-Extraction-Comparison-Using-ResNet50-with-Skin-Segmentation-and-Bilateral-Filtering
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to video keyframe extraction by combining advanced preprocessing techniques like skin segmentation and bilateral filtering with deep learning models such as ResNet50. By comparing keyframes extracted using Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Global Max Pooling (GMP), the project offers insights into which strategy best enhances frame diversity and reduces similarity, crucial for high-quality video analysis.

# Key Highlights:
Preprocessing: Skin segmentation and bilateral filtering to isolate key regions and reduce noise.

Feature Extraction: ResNet50 used to extract deep features with two pooling methods.

Comparison: Intra-set diversity and inter-set similarity metrics to evaluate pooling strategies.

This work is key for improving automated video analysis tasks, such as content summarization, action recognition, and frame-based video search.
